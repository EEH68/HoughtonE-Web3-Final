                        <p>The dovetail saw is used to cut joints in drawer runners, dividers, and stretchers. They are well balanced, maneuverable, and scaled for smaller work then a tenon saw.</p>

                        <p>A tenon saw is a large backsaw used for making deep, accurate cuts in furniture joinery. It should make straight, fast cuts without binding.</p>

                        <p>The carcass saw is used for precise cuts across the grain, cutting tenon shoulders, and defining the edges of a dado. The ideal compliment to the dovetail saw.</p>
