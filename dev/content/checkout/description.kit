                    <p>We believe that our dovetail saw are the finest made anywhere. They are based on a British saw made in 1830. Owning one is like having a piece of woodworking history in your shop.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Since dovetailing is a ripping operation, where the kerf is running with the grain, our Dovetail Saw has its teeth filed to a rip profile. Solid milled Brass back, finest quality Swedish Steel blade, Cherry handle and traditional Brass split nut saw bolts.</p>

                    <p>With 15 points per inch, this Saw strikes an ideal balance between surface finish and speed. Teeth are set at .003" per side for a .026" kerf — narrow to help you cut straight.</p>
